/// produce it. `coverage` means the same thing whichever produced it — the share of frames that
/// reached a pixel — so a reader can interpret it without knowing the entry point. `weight` cannot
/// be shared that way: it is `Σwᵢ` over whatever the producer weighted by, and those weights are
/// the algorithms' own (see the field). Statistical quality is channel-specific because rejection
/// can retain different samples in each RGB channel; monochrome and drizzle quality use shared
