# Scenarium

Scenarium is the node-graph framework: a serializable authoring model, a
compile → plan → execute pipeline, and an asynchronous worker. It depends only
on `common` in-tree. `lib.rs` is the public façade; implementation modules are
crate-private, so downstream crates import public concepts directly from
`scenarium`.

## Models and identities

The authoring `Graph` owns `Node`s keyed by `NodeId` plus side tables for input
bindings, event subscriptions, pinned outputs, and local graphs.
Identity exists only in the map key; `Node` is authored data and does not store
its id. Its cache mode is storage policy, not cache validity. `Graph` is the
persisted model. `Graph::validate` enforces node-id
uniqueness across the whole reachable authoring tree. Node removal and restoration
use `DetachedNode`, which keeps the id, node, all touching wiring, subscriptions,
and pins together.

Compilation produces a private, immutable `ExecutionProgram`. Composite nodes
are dissolved into flat function nodes and SoA pools. Top-level nodes retain
the UUID value of their authoring `NodeId` behind the distinct
`ExecutionNodeId` type; nested execution ids are derived with domain-separated
BLAKE3 from the enclosing instance ids and interior node id. `FlattenMap`
retains only the compact scope ancestry needed to attribute each execution id
to its authored node and enclosing instances. Targeted runs and runtime reports
use exact `ExecutionNodeId`s; the host projects them through the installed
`CompiledGraph` when it needs authoring identities.

## Compile, plan, execute

`Compiler::compile` runs synchronously on the host and returns a
`CompiledGraph`; compilation is independent of run seeds. Disabled leaves stay
in the program with an effective disabled bit inherited from composite
ancestors. Compile errors never enter the worker. Planning is structural: it
selects exact execution-node roots, treats those seeds as one-run disable
overrides, orders dependencies before consumers, and detects missing inputs.
Resolution stamps
content digests, then derives cache-aware liveness, exact `OutputDemand`, and
binding-reader counts together. Execution invokes the surviving nodes in plan
order. Event-loop bootstrap marks subscribed event owners as event sources,
forces their initialization lambdas to run instead of reusing output caches,
and prepares triggers only for sources that complete successfully. The worker
takes those exact runtime triggers from `ExecutionOutcome` and moves them into
event tasks; fired-event runs do not rebuild unrelated triggers.

Before resolution, `RunResourceStamps` collects filesystem identities and custom
resource stamps on Tokio's blocking pool. It memoizes each resource for one run
and is reused by late bound-resource restamps after producers settle, keeping
`node_digest` itself synchronous and I/O-free.

A cache slot is valid only when its digest matches and its
`OutputSnapshot` coverage contains every currently demanded output. Invocation
clears the output buffer first, so an output the lambda skips cannot retain a
stale value. Disk frames persist the same coverage; a same-digest write replaces
an older frame when the new result covers more outputs.

Only `FuncBehavior::Pure` cones receive reusable content digests. Resource
inputs fold the current referent identity through `ResourceStamper`; filesystem
paths have built-in stamping. Explicit cache eviction is a worker operation:
authored ids resolve through `CompiledGraph`, expand through transitive data
consumers, release resident outputs, and delete their node-keyed disk blobs.
Stampers receive the run's cooperative `CancelToken`. Custom runtime values are
not serializable.
Downstream types attach a `CustomValueCodec` explicitly when they want disk
cache support.

## Worker

One `Vec<WorkerMessage>` is one commit unit. `BatchIntent` preserves first-seen
order while deduplicating node seeds and events; conflicting state slots are
last-write-wins and `Exit` dominates its batch. Compiled programs are shared as
`Arc<CompiledGraph>` values. After applying a graph-state change, the worker
emits `Installed` or `Cleared` before any report belonging to the resulting
state; its single execution loop and callback preserve that FIFO stream.
Successful cache eviction is fire-and-forget. Operation-level execution and
cache-eviction failures both arrive as `WorkerReport::Error`.
`WorkerReport::Status` carries an `Arc<WorkerStatus>` with absolute activity,
batched live node patches, or an authoritative completed-run snapshot. The
`WorkerStatusPublisher` retains one status allocation and updates it through `Arc::make_mut`;
the GUI consumes and drops published snapshots, allowing subsequent reports to
reuse their vectors when no older snapshot is still queued.
`WorkerTask` likewise retains one `ExecutionOutcome`; the engine clears and
repopulates its buffers for each run, then completion drains them into the
status publisher without discarding their capacities.
`ActiveEventLoop` owns both its tasks and event receiver, so the activity
invariant is represented by one type. Event tasks rendezvous through Tokio's
`Barrier`; the worker's counted pause gate uses Tokio `watch` so overlapping
close guards reopen it only after the last guard drops. Worker reports stream
node-status patches and exact scoped pinned outputs before the matching
completion snapshot.

## Tests

Test fixtures and private-state builders are available only under tests or the
`internals` feature; downstream crates enable `internals` only as a dev
dependency. Test helpers stay in gated `test_support` modules beside the
private state they access.
